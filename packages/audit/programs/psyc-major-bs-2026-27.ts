  reviewNotes: [
    "All of the B.A. requirements below also apply to the B.S. (both sources: 'Students who wish to pursue the Bachelor of Science degree (B.S.) must complete all of the BA requirements ...'); see psyc-major-ba-2026-27.ts's reviewNotes for the PSYC100/B- override, the MATH136 exclusion, the per-theme overlay encoding (psyc-theme-1/2/3, from the department's PSYC Courses & PSYC Syllabi page), the psyc-total-credits overlay, the 400-level-lab approximation, and the admission-gate/engine-gap notes -- all identical here and not repeated.",
    "NOT encoded: the B.S.'s Additional Math and Science Requirement (5 courses/16 credits total in math and science, including the shared MATH120-or-140 and BSCI170 gateway courses, plus 3 more courses/10 credits of which at least 3 total are 'advanced' and at least 1 has a lab, with a 2.0 average across the 17-credit supporting sequence). Both sources point to a department-hosted approved list (psyc.umd.edu/undergraduate/degree-requirements) that wasn't part of the fetched source; the newly-fetched 'PSYC Courses & PSYC Syllabi' page (checked for this update) also has no such list -- it only enumerates PSYC courses by theme, not the approved math/science courses. The checklist's own B.S. section lists only placeholder rows ('BS Advanced Course 1/2/3'), naming no actual course. Per the builder brief, this isn't guessed from an unlisted department (could be MATH, BSCI, CHEM, PHYS, STAT or others) -- flagged in docs/project/owner-review.md instead. The B.S. Program below therefore encodes the identical checkable requirements as the B.A. track; the un-encoded math/science bucket is the only real difference between the two degrees.",
    "'PSYC courses counting towards the B.S. requirements will NOT count towards the thematic or 400-level requirements' and 'BS PSYC courses cannot count toward the 35 credits/11 course requirement' (both sources) can't be enforced either, since the B.S.-specific course pool itself isn't encoded (see above) -- there's nothing to wall off.",
