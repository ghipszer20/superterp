// Source: academiccatalog.umd.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/agriculture-natural-resources/
//   plant-sciences-landscape-architecture/agricultural-science-technology-major/ (fetched 2026-09-28).
// Two department pages were also fetched (program-sources/agricultural-science-technology-major.md):
// psla.umd.edu is the department's general home page (site navigation and news, no curriculum table
// for this major) and agnr.umd.edu/about/directory/melissa-welsh is one faculty member's profile.
// Neither names any requirement, so neither disagrees with the catalog and the "department page
// wins" owner ruling does not come into play here; only the catalog is encoded.
